# CDS Hooks 1.0 and 2.0 are published at 'https://cds-hooks.hl7.org/'. It's intentional for the CDS Hooks IG to link to the most recent published CDS Hooks Library IG. This is the same behavior that base FHIR references the FHIR Extensions Pack (base R5 points to the most recent extensions IG version, not the IG version published at the time of time).
The correct canonical URL for this dependency is https://cds-hooks.hl7.org/ImplementationGuide/hl7.fhir.uv.cds-hooks

# There are currently no profiles defined in the CDS Hooks or CDS Hooks Library specifications
ImplementationGuide.definition.resource: minimum required = 1, but only found 0 (from http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/ImplementationGuide|4.0.1)
The canonical URL for an Implementation Guide must point directly to the implementation guide resource, not to the Implementation Guide as a whole
